* ## Code

     Most of the QMC code I have contributed to can be found on [here](https://github.com/sanshar/VMC/tree/master). The scripts and input files used in the calculations reported in my papers are also available on [this github repo](https://github.com/Sharma-Group/Paper-Calculations).

* ## Some tutorials I made:

   * [A jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Sharma-Group/onboarding/blob/master/tutorials/hubbard_dmrg/hubbard_dmrg.ipynb) with simple code for doing DMRG on a small Hubbard chain with accompanying notes 

   * Some notes on wavelets in a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jamesETsmith/SharmaGroup/blob/master/groupmeetings_and_notes/wavelets/wavelets.ipynb) and a [mathematica notebook](https://github.com/jamesETsmith/SharmaGroup/blob/master/groupmeetings_and_notes/wavelets/wavelets.nb)

   * [A mathematica tutorial](https://github.com/jamesETsmith/SharmaGroup/blob/master/groupmeetings_and_notes/mathematicaTutorial/mathematicaTutorial.nb)
