    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I am currently in my third year of study at IIT Bombay. I completed my higher secondary studies from S.P.College, Pune and secondary
    studies from Kawathekar Highschool, Pandharpur, my hometown. I would like to pursue a career in physics research.</p>
    <h2>Physics Interests</h2>
    <p>My interests are inclined toward theoretical
    physics. What I like about the subject, besides it describing the nature, is how elegantly connected everything is. 
    Concepts appearing vastly different at the outset turn out to be closely related.</p>
    <p>Through the experience with <a href="projects.html#HH">the nonlinear dynamics project</a>, I'v developed a keen
    interest in computational physics. I was able to get a glimpse of the field of Condensed Matter Physics, while 
    <a href="projects.html#Superconductivity">studying superconductivity</a> and <a href="projects.html#BEC">BECs on atomic chips</a>. I found it
    fascinating to learn about the macroscopic manifestations 
    of quantum mechanics. The study in this field entails use of concepts from a variety
    of different areas of physics and it also has many direct applications. 
    I would also like to explore the field of quantum computation, although currently I've very little knowledge
    in this area. I would be interested in studying particle and high energy physics as well, after completing the field theory course. </p>
    <h2>Other Interests</h2>
    <p>Coding has come to be one of my favorite pastimes during the past two years. I've become interested in learning the 
    workings of the internet. I recently learned basics of web application development.</p>
    <p>I'm also a sports buff. Football(soccer), tennis, cricket, F1 and moto racing, golf are some of the sports I follow pretty regularly.
    (<i>Go Barca(and may be MANU), Roger, Hamilton, Rossi and Tiger!</i>)</p>
