title: About
---

I am a graduate student in chemical physics at University of Colorado, Boulder. I am interested in developing efficient algorithms for accurate simulations of electronic systems with strong interactions. I have worked on various Monte Carlo techniques to efficiently sample processes in the Hilbert spaces that electrons seem to inhabit. I did my undergraduate studies at IIT Bombay, majoring in physics with a minor in computer science. During undergrad, I dabbled in nonlinear dynamics of potentials in neurons and quantum nuclear dynamics. Details of my research can be found on the [projects](/projects) page.
