title: About
---

I'm a senior undergrad in the physics department at IIT Bombay. I have a minor in computer science. I'm primarily interested in theoretical and computational electronic structure theory. I've previously dabbled in nonlinear dynamics. My other interests include quantum computing and molecular dynamics. All of my research reports and key course project reports can be found on the [projects page](/projects).
