I am a postdoc in the [Reichman group](https://reichmangroup.chem.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. My research focuses on studying the structure and dynamics of many-body quantum systems using computational techniques. I work on quantum Monte Carlo methods for *ab initio* electronic structure calculations, particularly in strongly correlated systems. I also study electron-phonon interactions in condensed phases, exploring spectral and transport properties of polarons. I enjoy writing differentiable and performant code (in JAX ðŸ˜ƒ).

Current research areas include:

-   **Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo** for transition metal systems
-   **Electron-phonon coupling** using neural quantum states
-   **Chirality induced spin selectivity in transport** from first principles
